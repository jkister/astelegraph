Asterisk is a prerequisite.  See doc/INSTALL.asterisk
 * extensions.conf must be changed.  See eg/extensions.conf
Samba is a prerequisite.  See doc/INSTALL.samba
 * smb.conf must be changed.  See eg/smb.conf
Ghostsript is a prerequisite for PDF/PS.
 I installed right from https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/download/gs918/ghostscript-9.18-linux-x86_64.tgz

modify your [/etc/]astelegraph.cfg as appropriate.  Anything to the
right of a semi-colon (;) or a hash (#) are ignored.  Blank lines are
ignored.  Each line should should contain a <key>:<value>
 * outcontext: context for outbound calls [outbound]
               see eg/extensions.conf
 * faxcontext: context for fax calls [astelegraph]
               see eg/extensions.conf
 * debug:      enable debug logging (0=off, 1=on) [0]
 * extension:  extension in context to dial [tx]
               see eg/extensions.conf
 * facility:   syslog facility for logging [local6]
 * mailfrom:   who to send report emails from [root@example.com]
 * piddir:     directory to put PID file [/var/run]
 * spooldir:   asterisk spool directory [/var/spool/asterisk]
 * username:   switch to this less-privileged user after startup [nobody]
               a dedicated 'astelegraph' (or just 'asterisk') user would
               be appropriate here.
