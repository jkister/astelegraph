There are many examples how to make an incoming fax do things with Asterisk.  This package is designed to make outbound faxes prettier and easier.

All we do is configure a Samba folder so that users can browse a Windows/CIFS/Network Neighborhood share and just drop a PDF/PS/TIFF right in the window.  The file must be named the following format:
 DESTNUMBER[-user@example.com][-YYYYMMDDHHMM].ext

 for example:
  2155551234.pdf - blindly fax document to 215-555-1234
  2155551234-user@example.com.pdf - fax document to 215-555-1234 and email a report to user@example.com
  2155551234-203903141344.pdf - bindly fax document to 215-555-1234 at 1:44pm on March 14, 2039
  2155551234-user@example.com-203903141344.pdf - fax document to 215-555-1234 at 1:44pm on March 14, 2039 and email a report to user@example.com
  2155551234-203903141344-user@example.com.pdf - [same as above]
